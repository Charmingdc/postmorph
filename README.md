## üí° Usage

Once the application is running, here‚Äôs how you can use Postmorph to repurpose your content:

1.  **Account Creation and Sign-in**:
Upon visiting the application, you'll be directed to the authentication pages. You can sign up for a new account using your email and password, or quickly sign in with your Google account for a seamless experience.

2.  **Dashboard Overview**:
After successful authentication, you'll land on the dashboard. Here, you can get a quick overview of your remaining content credits and view your most recent repurposed drafts. This gives you a clear picture of your usage and content activity.

3.  **Repurpose Content**:
Navigate to the "Repurpose New" section.
*   **Select Input Format**: Choose the original format of your content (e.g., "blog", "youtube video", "instagram reel").
*   **Select Output Format**: Specify the desired target format for your repurposed content (e.g., "tweet", "x thread", "linkedin post").
*   **Choose Tone**: Select a writing tone (e.g., "professional", "casual", "funny") to match your brand's voice.
*   **Input Content**: Paste the raw content or the link (for video/reel inputs) into the provided input area.
*   **Generate**: Click the "Repurpose Now" button to let the AI transform your content. The results will appear shortly.

4.  **Manage Drafts**:
All your generated content drafts are saved and accessible under the "Drafts" section.
*   You can view a paginated list of all your drafts.
*   Each draft allows you to copy its content to your clipboard, edit it further, or delete it if no longer needed.

5.  **Define Brand Voice**:
In the "Brand Voice" section, you can add custom writing styles that align with your brand.
*   Give your custom voice a name and a description.
*   Optionally, you can provide a link to an existing post, and the system can automatically generate a description of that post's tone, which you can then save as a custom brand voice. This helps the AI understand your unique style.

6.  **Account Settings**:
Manage your profile information and account preferences via the "Account Settings" page.
