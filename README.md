1.  **Sign Up or Sign In**: Create an account using your email and password or instantly sign in with your Google account.
2.  **Navigate to Repurpose New**: On the sidebar (desktop) or via the central button in the mobile footer, access the "Repurpose New" page.
3.  **Select Formats**: Choose your "Input" format (e.g., Blog, YouTube Video) and your desired "Output" format (e.g., Tweet, LinkedIn Post).
4.  **Define Tone**: Select a default tone (professional, casual, funny, motivational) or add a custom brand voice under the "Brand Voice" section to ensure the AI generates content that perfectly matches your style.
5.  **Input Content**: Paste the link or the full content you wish to repurpose into the input area.
6.  **Repurpose Now**: Click the "Repurpose Now" button. The AI will process your request and generate the transformed content instantly.

8.  **Refine Content**: On the draft editor page, you can apply further refinements using the AI by entering specific prompts (e.g., "Add Hook", "Condense") to perfect your content.
9.  **Manage Brand Voices**: Under "Brand Voice," you can add new custom voices by providing a name, description, and specific instructions, or update/delete existing ones.
