# Postmorph: Intelligent Content Repurposing ‚ú®

## Overview
Postmorph is a cutting-edge Next.js application designed to streamline content repurposing and generation. It leverages the power of AI to transform content across various platforms and tones, while providing robust user authentication, draft management, and a personalized experience. Built with a modern tech stack including Next.js, Supabase, and Google Gemini AI, Postmorph empowers creators to efficiently adapt their content strategy.

## Usage
Postmorph offers a seamless workflow for content creators:

1.  **Select Formats & Tone**: Choose your original content's source format (e.g., blog, X thread) and your desired output format (e.g., tweet, LinkedIn post). Then, select a writing tone from pre-defined options or your custom brand voices.
2.  **Input Content**: Paste your content or a relevant link directly into the editor.
3.  **AI Transformation**: Click "Repurpose Now" to let the AI instantly transform your content based on your selections.
4.  **Review & Refine**: The AI-generated content appears in a flexible editor where you can make further edits, or use quick AI prompts (like "rephrase" or "add hook") to refine the output up to 3 times.
5.  **Save & Manage Drafts**: All generated content is automatically saved as drafts. You can access, edit, copy, or delete your drafts from a centralized dashboard.
6.  **Custom Brand Voices**: Define and store unique brand voices with specific instructions to ensure AI-generated content consistently aligns with your brand's identity.
