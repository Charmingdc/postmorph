# Postmorph: AI-Powered Content Repurposing Platform

Postmorph is a robust Next.js application engineered to revolutionize content strategy through intelligent AI-powered repurposing. It provides a seamless platform for users to efficiently transform long-form content into optimized formats for various social media platforms, supported by a secure authentication system and scalable data management.

## Project Overview

This project is a full-stack Next.js application leveraging server actions and API routes for dynamic content generation and user management. It features comprehensive user authentication, content storage, and integration with generative AI models to provide a powerful content repurposing experience.

## Features

-   **Content Repurposing**: Transforms various input formats (blogs, YouTube videos, Instagram reels, X threads, LinkedIn posts) into diverse output formats (tweets, X threads, LinkedIn posts, Reddit posts) with customizable tones.
-   **Draft Management**: Stores generated content as drafts, allowing users to review, modify, copy, or delete them.
-   **AI-Powered Refinement**: Provides an in-editor modification tool to refine drafts using custom prompts, with a set limit on refinements per draft.
-   **Brand Voice Customization**: Enables users to define and manage custom brand voices, influencing the AI's content generation style.

## Usage

Postmorph provides a streamlined workflow for content repurposing:

1.  **Authentication**: Begin by signing up or signing in to your account. Google OAuth is supported for quick access, alongside traditional email and password.
2.  **Repurpose Content**:
    *   Navigate to the "Repurpose New" section.
    *   Select your `Input Format` (e.g., "blog", "youtube video").
    *   Choose your desired `Output Format` (e.g., "tweet", "linkedin post").
    *   Set the `Tone` for the generated content (e.g., "professional", "casual").
    *   Paste your content or link into the input area.
    *   Click "Repurpose Now" to generate your new content.
3.  **Manage Drafts**: All generated content is saved as drafts.
    *   Access your drafts from the "Drafts" section.
    *   Each draft can be copied, edited, or deleted.
    *   In the editor, you can apply further modifications using custom prompts or pre-defined actions like "Add Hook", "Fix Grammar", "Condense", "Expand", "Rephrase", and "Improve Structure". Each draft has a limited number of refinements.
4.  **Brand Voice**:
    *   In the "Brand Voice" section, define and manage custom writing styles that reflect your brand.
    *   You can manually input voice details (name, description, instruction) or generate them from an existing post link.
5.  **Account Settings**:
    *   Manage your profile in the "Account Settings" section.
    *   Update your full name, change your avatar, or adjust security settings like your password. For Google-linked accounts, some settings are managed directly through Google.
